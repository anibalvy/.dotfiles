# Job control consists of the following commands:
# 
# - The fg command moves a background job into the foreground.
# - The bg command moves a suspended foreground job into the background.
# - The jobs command shows the current list of jobs.
# - The kill command can kill jobs or send signals to them.
# - The disown command removes a job from the list of jobs (without killing it).
# - A foreground job can be suspended by typing ^Z (Control-Z). A suspended job is temporarily stopped.
