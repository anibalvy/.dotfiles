#     - tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2:4] -> It extracts the 4-bit Data Offset field from the TCP header, multiplies it by 4 to compute the size of the header in bytes (which is also the offset to the data), then extracts 4 bytes at this offset to get the first 4 bytes of the data,
#     - 0x504f5354 -> identify if is Post requests when packets arrives, it's POST in ascii hex (P=50, O=4f, S=53, T=54)

tshark -i <interface> -x -f "port 443" # capture all https (it will be encrypted)
