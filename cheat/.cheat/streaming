## STREAMING: communication protocol for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet.

### network protocol
#### RTP - Real-time Transport Protocol
  Is a network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks.
  RTP is used in communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media, such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC, television services and web-based push-to-talk features.
  RTP typically runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
  RTP is used in conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP).
  While RTP carries the media streams (e.g., audio and video), RTCP is used to monitor transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS) and aids synchronization of multiple streams.
  RTP is one of the technical foundations of Voice over IP and in this context is often used in conjunction with a signaling protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) which establishes connections across the network.

#### SRT - Secure Reliable Transport
  - Is an open source video transport protocol that utilises the UDP transport protocol. The SRT Protocol specification is available as an Internet Draft from the IETF.
  - SRT provides connection and control, reliable transmission similar to TCP; however, it does so at the application layer, using UDP protocol as an underlying transport layer.
  - It supports packet recovery while maintaining low latency (default: 120 ms).
  - SRT also supports encryption using AES.

### communication protocol
#### RTMP - Real-Time Messaging Protocol
  - Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is a communication protocol for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet.
  - Originally developed as a proprietary protocol by Macromedia for streaming between Flash Player and the Flash Communication Server, Adobe (which acquired Macromedia) has released an incomplete version of the specification of the protocol for public use.
  - Normally, it can’t be used for streaming HEVC encoded content.

  - RTMP is a TCP-based protocol which maintains persistent connections and allows low-latency communication.
  - The RTMP defines several virtual channels on which packets may be sent and received, and which operate independently of each other.
  - For example:
    - there is a channel for handling RPC requests and responses.
    - a channel for video stream data.
    - a channel for audio stream data.
    - a channel for out-of-band control messages (fragment size negotiation. etc.).
    - and so on.

  - During a typical RTMP session, several channels may be active simultaneously at any given time.
    - When RTMP data is encoded, a packet header is generated.
    - The packet header specifies, amongst other matters, the ID of the channel on which it is to be sent, a timestamp of when it was generated (if necessary), and the size of the packet's payload.
    - This header is then followed by the actual payload content of the packet, which is fragmented according to the currently agreed-upon fragment size before it is sent over the connection.
    - The packet header itself is never fragmented, and its size does not count towards the data in the packet's first fragment. In other words, only the actual packet payload (the media data) is subject to fragmentation.

  - At a higher level, the RTMP encapsulates MP3 or AAC audio and FLV1 video multimedia streams, and can make remote procedure calls (RPCs) using the Action Message Format.
  - Any RPC services required are made asynchronously, using a single client/server request/response model, such that real-time communication is not required.

  - The RTMP protocol has multiple variations:

   - RTMP proper, the "plain" protocol which works on top of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and uses port number 1935 by default.
   - RTMPS, (encrypted) which is RTMP over a Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) connection.
   - RTMPE, (encrypted) which is RTMP encrypted using Adobe's own security mechanism. While the details of the implementation are proprietary, the mechanism uses industry standard cryptographic primitives.[1]
   - RTMPT, (tunneling) which is encapsulated within HTTP requests to traverse firewalls. RTMPT is frequently found utilizing cleartext requests on TCP ports 80 and 443 to bypass most corporate traffic filtering. The encapsulated session may carry plain RTMP, RTMPS, or RTMPE packets within.
   - RTMFP, which is RTMP over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead of TCP, replacing RTMP Chunk Stream. The Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol suite has been developed by Adobe Systems and enables end‐users to connect and communicate directly with each other (P2P).

  While the primary motivation for RTMP was to be a protocol for playing Flash video, it is also used in some other applications, such as the Adobe LiveCycle Data Services ES.


### Adaptive bitrate streaming
Is a technique used in streaming multimedia over computer networks.
- The concept came from storing MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 DVD TS Sectors into small 2KB files, which will be served using an HTTP server to the player.

#### Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)
#### Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
#### Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS)
#### Microsoft Smooth Streaming (MSS)
#### Common Media Application Format (CMAF)
#### QuavStreams Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
#### Uplynk
#### Self-learning clients


### streaming media software
#### VLC
#### OBS
#### Nimble Streamer
#### Icecast
  - The Icecast server is capable of streaming audio content as Opus or Vorbis[7] over standard HTTP, video as WebM or Theora[7] over HTTP, and MP3,[7] AAC,[6] and NSV[6] over the SHOUTcast protocol.
  - Theora, AAC, and NSV are only supported in version 2.2.0 and newer.
