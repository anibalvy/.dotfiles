# let introduces a variable binding:
let x; // declare "x"
x = 42; // assign 42 to "x"
let x = 42; // This can also be written as a single line:

# You can specify the variable's type explicitly with :, that's a type annotation:
let x: i32; // `i32` is a signed 32-bit integer
x = 42;
// there's i8, i16, i32, i64, i128
//    also u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 for unsigned
let x: i32 = 42; //This can also be written as a single line:

# If you declare a name and initialize it later, the compiler will prevent you from using it before it's initialized.
let x;
foobar(x); // error: borrow of possibly-uninitialized variable: `x`
x = 42;

# However, doing this is completely fine:
let x;
x = 42;
foobar(x); // the type of `x` will be inferred from here

# The underscore _ is a special name - or rather, a "lack of name". It basically means to throw away something:
let _ = 42; // this does *nothing* because 42 is a constant
let _ = get_thing(); // this calls `get_thing` but throws away its result

# Names that start with an underscore are regular names, it's just that the compiler won't warn about them being unused:
// we may use `_x` eventually, but our code is a work-in-progress
// and we just wanted to get rid of a compiler warning for now.
let _x = 42;

# Separate bindings with the same name can be introduced - you can shadow a variable binding:
let x = 13;
let x = x + 3; // using `x` after that line only refers to the second `x`, the first `x` no longer exists.

# Rust has tuples, which you can think of as "fixed-length collections of values of different types".
let pair = ('a', 17);
pair.0; // this is 'a'
pair.1; // this is 17

# If we really wanted to annotate the type of pair, we would write:
let pair: (char, i32) = ('a', 17);

# Tuples can be destructured when doing an assignment, which means they're broken down into their individual fields:
let (some_char, some_int) = ('a', 17); // now, `some_char` is 'a', and `some_int` is 17

# This is especially useful when a function returns a tuple:
let (left, right) = slice.split_at(middle);
let (_, right) = slice.split_at(middle); // Of course, when destructuring a tuple, _ can be used to throw away part of it:

# The semi-colon marks the end of a statement:
let x = 3;
let y = 5;
let z = y + x;

# Which means statements can span multiple lines:
let x = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    .iter()
    .map(|x| x + 3)
    .fold(0, |x, y| x + y);


# fn declares a function. Here's a void function:
fn greet() {
    println!("Hi there!");
}

# And here's a function that returns a 32-bit signed integer. The arrow indicates its return type:
fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 {
    4
}

# A pair of brackets declares a block, which has its own scope:
// This prints "in", then "out"
fn main() {
    let x = "out";
    {
        let x = "in"; // this is a different `x`
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    println!("{}", x);
}

# Blocks are also expressions, which mean they evaluate to.. a value.
// this:
let x = 42;
// is equivalent to this:
let x = { 42 };

# Inside a block, there can be multiple statements:
let x = {
    let y = 1; // first statement
    let z = 2; // second statement
    y + z // this is the *tail* - what the whole block will evaluate to
};

# And that's why "omitting the semicolon at the end of a function" is the same as returning, ie. these are equivalent:
fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 {
    return 4;
}

fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 {
    4
}

# if conditionals are also expressions:
fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 {
    if feeling_lucky {
        6
    } else {
        4
    }
}

# A match is also an expression:
fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 {
    match feeling_lucky {
        true => 6,
        false => 4,
    }
}

# Dots are typically used to access fields of a value:
let a = (10, 20);
a.0; // this is 10

let amos = get_some_struct();
amos.nickname; // this is "fasterthanlime"

# Or call a method on a value:
let nick = "fasterthanlime";
nick.len(); // this is 14

# The double-colon, ::, is similar but it operates on namespaces.
# In this example, std is a crate (~ a library), cmp is a module (~ a source file), and min is a function:
let least = std::cmp::min(3, 8); // this is 3

# use directives can be used to "bring in scope" names from other namespace:
use std::cmp::min;
let least = min(7, 1); // this is 1

# Within use directives, curly brackets have another meaning: they're "globs". If we want to import both min and max, we can do any of these:
use std::cmp::min; // this works:
use std::cmp::max; // this works:

use std::cmp::{min, max}; // this also works:

use std::{cmp::min, cmp::max}; // this also works!

# A wildcard (*) lets you import every symbol from a namespace:
use std::cmp::*; // this brings `min` and `max` in scope, and many other things

# Types are namespaces too, and methods can be called as regular functions:
let x = "amos".len(); // this is 4
let x = str::len("amos"); // this is also 4

# str is a primitive type, but many non-primitive types are also in scope by default.
let v = Vec::new(); // `Vec` is a regular struct, not a primitive type
let v = std::vec::Vec::new(); // this is exactly the same code, but with the *full* path to `Vec`

# This works because Rust inserts this at the beginning of every module:
use std::prelude::v1::*;
# (Which in turns re-exports a lot of symbols, like Vec, String, Option and Result).

# Structs are declared with the struct keyword:
struct Vec2 {
    x: f64, // 64-bit floating point, aka "double precision"
    y: f64,
}

# They can be initialized using struct literals:
let v1 = Vec2 { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 };
let v2 = Vec2 { y: 2.0, x: 4.0 }; // the order does not matter, only the names do

# There is a shortcut for initializing the rest of the fields from another struct:
let v3 = Vec2 {
    x: 14.0,
    ..v2
};
# This is called "struct update syntax", can only happen in last position, and cannot be followed by a comma.
# Note that the rest of the fields can mean all the fields:
let v4 = Vec2 { ..v3 };

# Structs, like tuples, can be destructured. Just like this is a valid let pattern:
let (left, right) = slice.split_at(middle);

# So is this:
let v = Vec2 { x: 3.0, y: 6.0 };
let Vec2 { x, y } = v; // `x` is now 3.0, `y` is now `6.0`

# And this:
let Vec2 { x, .. } = v; // this throws away `v.y`

# let patterns can be used as conditions in if:
struct Number {
    odd: bool,
    value: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let one = Number { odd: true, value: 1 };
    let two = Number { odd: false, value: 2 };
    print_number(one);
    print_number(two);
}

fn print_number(n: Number) {
    if let Number { odd: true, value } = n {
        println!("Odd number: {}", value);
    } else if let Number { odd: false, value } = n {
        println!("Even number: {}", value);
    }
}
// this prints:
// Odd number: 1
// Even number: 2

# match arms are also patterns, just like if let:
fn print_number(n: Number) {
    match n {
        Number { odd: true, value } => println!("Odd number: {}", value),
        Number { odd: false, value } => println!("Even number: {}", value),
    }
} // this prints the same as before

# A match has to be exhaustive: at least one arm needs to match.
fn print_number(n: Number) {
    match n {
        Number { value: 1, .. } => println!("One"),
        Number { value: 2, .. } => println!("Two"),
        Number { value, .. } => println!("{}", value),
        // if that last arm didn't exist, we would get a compile-time error
    }
}

# If that's hard, _ can be used as a "catch-all" pattern:
fn print_number(n: Number) {
    match n.value {
        1 => println!("One"),
        2 => println!("Two"),
        _ => println!("{}", n.value),
    }
}

# You can declare methods on your own types:
struct Number {
    odd: bool,
    value: i32,
}

impl Number {
    fn is_strictly_positive(self) -> bool {
        self.value > 0
    }
}

# And use them like usual:
fn main() {
    let minus_two = Number {
        odd: false,
        value: -2,
    };
    println!("positive? {}", minus_two.is_strictly_positive());
    // this prints "positive? false"
}

# Variable bindings are immutable by default, which means their interior can't be mutated:
fn main() {
    let n = Number {
        odd: true,
        value: 17,
    };
    n.odd = false; // error: cannot assign to `n.odd`,
                   // as `n` is not declared to be mutable
}

# And also that they cannot be assigned to:
fn main() {
    let n = Number {
        odd: true,
        value: 17,
    };
    n = Number {
        odd: false,
        value: 22,
    }; // error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `n`
}

# mut makes a variable binding mutable:
fn main() {
    let mut n = Number {
        odd: true,
        value: 17,
    }
    n.value = 19; // all good
}

# Traits are something multiple types can have in common:
trait Signed {
    fn is_strictly_negative(self) -> bool;
}

# You can implement:
#
#     -  one of your traits on anyone's type
#     -  anyone's trait on one of your types
#     -  but not a foreign trait on a foreign type
#
# These are called the "orphan rules".

# Here's an implementation of our trait on our type:
impl Signed for Number {
    fn is_strictly_negative(self) -> bool {
        self.value < 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let n = Number { odd: false, value: -44 };
    println!("{}", n.is_strictly_negative()); // prints "true"
}

# Our trait on a foreign type (a primitive type, even):
impl Signed for i32 {
    fn is_strictly_negative(self) -> bool {
        self < 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let n: i32 = -44;
    println!("{}", n.is_strictly_negative()); // prints "true"
}

# A foreign trait on our type:
// the `Neg` trait is used to overload `-`, the unary minus operator.
impl std::ops::Neg for Number {
    type Output = Number;

    fn neg(self) -> Number {
        Number {
            value: -self.value,
            odd: self.odd,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let n = Number { odd: true, value: 987 };
    let m = -n; // this is only possible because we implemented `Neg`
    println!("{}", m.value); // prints "-987"
}

# An impl block is always for a type, so, inside that block, Self means that type:
impl std::ops::Neg for Number {
    type Output = Self;

    fn neg(self) -> Self {
        Self {
            value: -self.value,
            odd: self.odd,
        }
    }
}

# Some traits are markers - they don't say that a type implements some methods, they say that certain things can be done with a type.
# For example, i32 implements trait Copy (in short, i32 is Copy), so this works:
fn main() {
    let a: i32 = 15;
    let b = a; // `a` is copied
    let c = a; // `a` is copied again
}

# And this also works:
fn print_i32(x: i32) {
    println!("x = {}", x);
}

fn main() {
    let a: i32 = 15;
    print_i32(a); // `a` is copied
    print_i32(a); // `a` is copied again
}

# But the Number struct is not Copy, so this doesn't work:
fn main() {
    let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };
    let m = n; // `n` is moved into `m`
    let o = n; // error: use of moved value: `n`
}

# And neither does this:
fn print_number(n: Number) {
    println!("{} number {}", if n.odd { "odd" } else { "even" }, n.value);
}

fn main() {
    let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };
    print_number(n); // `n` is moved
    print_number(n); // error: use of moved value: `n`
}

# But it works if print_number takes an immutable reference instead:
fn print_number(n: &Number) {
    println!("{} number {}", if n.odd { "odd" } else { "even" }, n.value);
}

fn main() {
    let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };
    print_number(&n); // `n` is borrowed for the time of the call
    print_number(&n); // `n` is borrowed again
}

# It also works if a function takes a mutable reference - but only if our variable binding is also mut.
fn invert(n: &mut Number) {
    n.value = -n.value;
}

fn print_number(n: &Number) {
    println!("{} number {}", if n.odd { "odd" } else { "even" }, n.value);
}

fn main() {
    // this time, `n` is mutable
    let mut n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };
    print_number(&n);
    invert(&mut n); // `n is borrowed mutably - everything is explicit
    print_number(&n);
}

# Trait methods can also take self by reference or mutable reference:
impl std::clone::Clone for Number {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Self { ..*self }
    }
}

# When invoking trait methods, the receiver is borrowed implicitly:
fn main() {
    let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };
    let mut m = n.clone();
    m.value += 100;

    print_number(&n);
    print_number(&m);
}

# To highlight this: these are equivalent:
let m = n.clone();

let m = std::clone::Clone::clone(&n);

# Marker traits like Copy have no methods:
// note: `Copy` requires that `Clone` is implemented too
impl std::clone::Clone for Number {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Self { ..*self }
    }
}

impl std::marker::Copy for Number {}

# Now, Clone can still be used:
fn main() {
    let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };
    let m = n.clone();
    let o = n.clone();
}

# But Number values will no longer be moved:
fn main() {
    let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };
    let m = n; // `m` is a copy of `n`
    let o = n; // same. `n` is neither moved nor borrowed.
}

# Some traits are so common, they can be implemented automatically by using the derive attribute:
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Number {
    odd: bool,
    value: i32,
} // this expands to `impl Clone for Number` and `impl Copy for Number` blocks.

# Functions can be generic:
fn foobar<T>(arg: T) {
    // do something with `arg`
}

# They can have multiple type parameters, which can then be used in the function's declaration and its body, instead of concrete types:
fn foobar<L, R>(left: L, right: R) {
    // do something with `left` and `right`
}

# Type parameters usually have constraints, so you can actually do something with them.
# The simplest constraints are just trait names:
fn print<T: Display>(value: T) {
    println!("value = {}", value);
}

fn print<T: Debug>(value: T) {
    println!("value = {:?}", value);
}

# There's a longer syntax for type parameter constraints:
fn print<T>(value: T)
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("value = {}", value);
}

# Constraints can be more complicated: they can require a type parameter to implement multiple traits:
use std::fmt::Debug;

fn compare<T>(left: T, right: T)
where
    T: Debug + PartialEq,
{
    println!("{:?} {} {:?}", left, if left == right { "==" } else { "!=" }, right);
}

fn main() {
    compare("tea", "coffee");
    // prints: "tea" != "coffee"
}

# Generic functions can be thought of as namespaces, containing an infinity of functions with different concrete types.
# Same as with crates, and modules, and types, generic functions can be "explored" (navigated?) using ::
fn main() {
    use std::any::type_name;
    println!("{}", type_name::<i32>()); // prints "i32"
    println!("{}", type_name::<(f64, char)>()); // prints "(f64, char)"
}

# This is lovingly called turbofish syntax, because ::<> looks like a fish.
# Structs can be generic too:
struct Pair<T> {
    a: T,
    b: T,
}

fn print_type_name<T>(_val: &T) {
    println!("{}", std::any::type_name::<T>());
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Pair { a: 3, b: 9 };
    let p2 = Pair { a: true, b: false };
    print_type_name(&p1); // prints "Pair<i32>"
    print_type_name(&p2); // prints "Pair<bool>"
}

# The standard library type Vec (~ a heap-allocated array), is generic:
fn main() {
    let mut v1 = Vec::new();
    v1.push(1);
    let mut v2 = Vec::new();
    v2.push(false);
    print_type_name(&v1); // prints "Vec<i32>"
    print_type_name(&v2); // prints "Vec<bool>"
}

# Speaking of Vec, it comes with a macro that gives more or less "vec literals":
fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let v2 = vec![true, false, true];
    print_type_name(&v1); // prints "Vec<i32>"
    print_type_name(&v2); // prints "Vec<bool>"
}

# All of name!(), name![] or name!{} invoke a macro. Macros just expand to regular code.
# In fact, println is a macro:
fn main() {
    println!("{}", "Hello there!");
}

# This expands to something that has the same effect as:
fn main() {
    use std::io::{self, Write};
    io::stdout().lock().write_all(b"Hello there!\n").unwrap();
}

# panic is also a macro. It violently stops execution with an error message, and the file name / line number of the error, if enabled:
fn main() {
    panic!("This panics");
} // output: thread 'main' panicked at 'This panics', src/main.rs:3:5

# Some methods also panic. For example, the Option type can contain something, or it can contain nothing. If .unwrap() is called on it, and it contains nothing, it panics:
fn main() {
    let o1: Option<i32> = Some(128);
    o1.unwrap(); // this is fine

    let o2: Option<i32> = None;
    o2.unwrap(); // this panics!
} // output: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', src/libcore/option.rs:378:21

# Option is not a struct - it's an enum, with two variants.
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}

impl<T> Option<T> {
    fn unwrap(self) -> T {
        // enums variants can be used in patterns:
        match self {
            Self::Some(t) => t,
            Self::None => panic!(".unwrap() called on a None option"),
        }
    }
}

use self::Option::{None, Some};

fn main() {
    let o1: Option<i32> = Some(128);
    o1.unwrap(); // this is fine

    let o2: Option<i32> = None;
    o2.unwrap(); // this panics!
} // output: thread 'main' panicked at '.unwrap() called on a None option', src/main.rs:11:27

# Result is also an enum, it can either contain something, or an error:
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
# It also panics when unwrapped and containing an error.

# Variables bindings have a "lifetime":
fn main() {
    // `x` doesn't exist yet
    {
        let x = 42; // `x` starts existing
        println!("x = {}", x); // `x` stops existing
    }
    // `x` no longer exists
}

# Similarly, references have a lifetime:
fn main() {
    // `x` doesn't exist yet
    {
        let x = 42; // `x` starts existing
        let x_ref = &x; // `x_ref` starts existing - it borrows `x`
        println!("x_ref = {}", x_ref);
        // `x_ref` stops existing
        // `x` stops existing
    }
    // `x` no longer exists
}

# The lifetime of a reference cannot exceed the lifetime of the variable binding it borrows:
fn main() {
    let x_ref = {
        let x = 42;
        &x
    };
    println!("x_ref = {}", x_ref);
    // error: `x` does not live long enough
}

# A variable binding can be immutably borrowed multiple times:
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    let x_ref1 = &x;
    let x_ref2 = &x;
    let x_ref3 = &x;
    println!("{} {} {}", x_ref1, x_ref2, x_ref3);
}

# While borrowed, a variable binding cannot be mutated:
fn main() {
    let mut x = 42;
    let x_ref = &x;
    x = 13;
    println!("x_ref = {}", x_ref);
    // error: cannot assign to `x` because it is borrowed
}

# While immutably borrowed, a variable cannot be mutably borrowed:
fn main() {
    let mut x = 42;
    let x_ref1 = &x;
    let x_ref2 = &mut x;
    // error: cannot borrow `x` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    println!("x_ref1 = {}", x_ref1);
}

# References in function arguments also have lifetimes:
fn print(x: &i32) {
    // `x` is borrowed (from the outside) for the
    // entire time this function is called.
}

# Functions with reference arguments can be called with borrows that have different lifetimes, so:
#
#     - All functions that take references are generic
#     - Lifetimes are generic parameters
#
# Lifetimes' names start with a single quote, ':
// elided (non-named) lifetimes:
fn print(x: &i32) {}

// named lifetimes:
fn print<'a>(x: &'a i32) {}

# This allows returning references whose lifetime depend on the lifetime of the arguments:
struct Number {
    value: i32,
}

fn number_value<'a>(num: &'a Number) -> &'a i32 {
    &num.value
}

fn main() {
    let n = Number { value: 47 };
    let v = number_value(&n);
    // `v` borrows `n` (immutably), thus: `v` cannot outlive `n`.
    // While `v` exists, `n` cannot be mutably borrowed, mutated, moved, etc.
}

# When there is a single input lifetime, it doesn't need to be named, and everything has the same lifetime, so the two functions below are equivalent:
fn number_value<'a>(num: &'a Number) -> &'a i32 {
    &num.value
}

fn number_value(num: &Number) -> &i32 {
    &num.value
}

# Structs can also be generic over lifetimes, which allows them to hold references:
struct NumRef<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 99;
    let x_ref = NumRef { x: &x };
    // `x_ref` cannot outlive `x`, etc.
}

# The same code, but with an additional function:
struct NumRef<'a> {

}

fn as_num_ref<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> NumRef<'a> {
    NumRef { x: &x }
}

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 99;
    let x_ref = as_num_ref(&x);
    // `x_ref` cannot outlive `x`, etc.
}

# The same code, but with "elided" lifetimes:
struct NumRef<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

fn as_num_ref(x: &i32) -> NumRef<'_> {
    NumRef { x: &x }
}

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 99;
    let x_ref = as_num_ref(&x);
    // `x_ref` cannot outlive `x`, etc.
}

# impl blocks can be generic over lifetimes too:
impl<'a> NumRef<'a> {
    fn as_i32_ref(&'a self) -> &'a i32 {
        self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 99;
    let x_num_ref = NumRef { x: &x };
    let x_i32_ref = x_num_ref.as_i32_ref();
    // neither ref can outlive `x`
}

# But you can do elision ("to elide") there too:
impl<'a> NumRef<'a> {
    fn as_i32_ref(&self) -> &i32 {
        self.x
    }
}

# You can elide even harder, if you never need the name:
impl NumRef<'_> {
    fn as_i32_ref(&self) -> &i32 {
        self.x
    }
}

# There is a special lifetime, named 'static, which is valid for the entire program's lifetime.
# String literals are 'static:
struct Person {
    name: &'static str,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Person {
        name: "fasterthanlime",
    };
}

# But owned strings are not static:
struct Person {
    name: &'static str,
}

fn main() {
    let name = format!("fasterthan{}", "lime");
    let p = Person { name: &name };
    // error: `name` does not live long enough
}

# In that last example, the local name is not a &'static str, it's a String. It's been allocated dynamically, and it will be freed.
# Its lifetime is less than the whole program (even though it happens to be in main).
# To store a non-'static string in Person, it needs to either:
# A) Be generic over a lifetime:
struct Person<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let name = format!("fasterthan{}", "lime");
    let p = Person { name: &name };
    // `p` cannot outlive `name`
}

# or B) Take ownership of the string
struct Person {
    name: String,
}

fn main() {
    let name = format!("fasterthan{}", "lime");
    let p = Person { name: name };
    // `name` was moved into `p`, their lifetimes are no longer tied.
}

# Speaking of: in a struct literal, when a field is set to a variable binding of the same name:
    let p = Person { name: name };

# It can be shortened like this:
    let p = Person { name };

# For many types in Rust, there are owned and non-owned variants:
#
#   - Strings: String is owned, &str is a reference
#   - Paths: PathBuf is owned, &Path is a reference
#   - Collections: Vec<T> is owned, &[T] is a reference

# Rust has slices - they're a reference to multiple contiguous elements.
# You can borrow a slice of a vector, for example:
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let v2 = &v[2..4];
    println!("v2 = {:?}", v2);
} // output: v2 = [3, 4]

# The above is not magical. The indexing operator (foo[index]) is overloaded with the Index and IndexMut traits.
# The .. syntax is just range literals. Ranges are just a few structs defined in the standard library.
# They can be open-ended, and their rightmost bound can be inclusive, if it's preceded by =.
fn main() {
    // 0 or greater
    println!("{:?}", (0..).contains(&100)); // true
    // strictly less than 20
    println!("{:?}", (..20).contains(&20)); // false
    // 20 or less than 20
    println!("{:?}", (..=20).contains(&20)); // true
    // only 3, 4, 5
    println!("{:?}", (3..6).contains(&4)); // true
}

# Borrowing rules apply to slices.
fn tail(s: &[u8]) -> &[u8] {
  &s[1..]
}

fn main() {
    let x = &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let y = tail(x);
    println!("y = {:?}", y);
}

# This is the same as:
fn tail<'a>(s: &'a [u8]) -> &'a [u8] {
  &s[1..]
}

# This is legal:
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        tail(x)
    };
    println!("y = {:?}", y);
}

# ...but only because [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is a 'static array.
# So, this is illegal:
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        tail(&v)
        // error: `v` does not live long enough
    };
    println!("y = {:?}", y);
}

# ...because a vector is heap-allocated, and it has a non-'static lifetime.
# &str values are really slices.
fn file_ext(name: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    // this does not create a new string - it returns
    // a slice of the argument.
    name.split(".").last()
}

fn main() {
    let name = "Read me. Or don't.txt";
    if let Some(ext) = file_ext(name) {
        println!("file extension: {}", ext);
    } else {
        println!("no file extension");
    }
}

# ...so the borrow rules apply here too:
fn main() {
    let ext = {
        let name = String::from("Read me. Or don't.txt");
        file_ext(&name).unwrap_or("")
        // error: `name` does not live long enough
    };
    println!("extension: {:?}", ext);
}

# Functions that can fail typically return a Result:
fn main() {
    let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]);
    println!("{:?}", s);
    // prints: Ok("🍉")

    let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[195, 40]);
    println!("{:?}", s);
    // prints: Err(Utf8Error { valid_up_to: 0, error_len: Some(1) })
}

# If you want to panic in case of failure, you can .unwrap():
fn main() {
    let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", s);
    // prints: "🍉"

    let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[195, 40]).unwrap();
    // prints: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()`
    // on an `Err` value: Utf8Error { valid_up_to: 0, error_len: Some(1) }',
    // src/libcore/result.rs:1165:5
}

# Or .expect(), for a custom message:
fn main() {
    let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[195, 40]).expect("valid utf-8");
    // prints: thread 'main' panicked at 'valid utf-8: Utf8Error
    // { valid_up_to: 0, error_len: Some(1) }', src/libcore/result.rs:1165:5
}

# Or, you can match:
fn main() {
    match std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]) {
        Ok(s) => println!("{}", s),
        Err(e) => panic!(e),
    }
    // prints 🍉
}

# Or you can if let:
fn main() {
    if let Ok(s) = std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]) {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
    // prints 🍉
}

# Or you can bubble up the error:
fn main() -> Result<(), std::str::Utf8Error> {
    match std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]) {
        Ok(s) => println!("{}", s),
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    }
    Ok(())
}

# Or you can use ? to do it the concise way:
fn main() -> Result<(), std::str::Utf8Error> {
    let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137])?;
    println!("{}", s);
    Ok(())
}

# The * operator can be used to dereference, but you don't need to do that to access fields or call methods:
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 };
    let p_ref = &p;
    println!("({}, {})", p_ref.x, p_ref.y);
}

// prints `(1, 3)`

# And you can only do it if the type is Copy:
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

fn negate(p: Point) -> Point {
    Point {
        x: -p.x,
        y: -p.y,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 };
    let p_ref = &p;
    negate(*p_ref);
    // error: cannot move out of `*p_ref` which is behind a shared reference
}


// now `Point` is `Copy`
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

fn negate(p: Point) -> Point {
    Point {
        x: -p.x,
        y: -p.y,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 };
    let p_ref = &p;
    negate(*p_ref); // ...and now this works
}

# Closures are just functions of type Fn, FnMut or FnOnce with some captured context.

    for_each_planet(move |planet| println!("{}, {}", greeting, planet));
    // `greeting` is no longer borrowed, it is *moved* into

}

# An FnMut needs to be mutably borrowed to be called, so it can only be called once at a time.
# This is legal:
fn foobar<F>(f: F)
    where F: Fn(i32) -> i32
{
    println!("{}", f(f(2)));
}

fn main() {
    foobar(|x| x * 2);

# This isn't:

{
    let tmp = f(2);
    println!("{}", f(tmp));
}

fn main() {
    foobar(|x| x * 2);
}

// output: 8

# FnMut exists because some closures mutably borrow local variables:

{

    println!("{}", f(tmp));
}

fn main() {

        acc += 1;
        x * acc
    });
}

// output: 24

# Those closures cannot be passed to functions expecting Fn:
fn foobar<F>(f: F)
    where F: Fn(i32) -> i32
{
    println!("{}", f(f(2)));
}

fn main() {
    let mut acc = 2;
    foobar(|x| {
        acc += 1;
        // error: cannot assign to `acc`, as it is a
        // captured variable in a `Fn` closure.
        // the compiler suggests "changing foobar
        // to accept closures that implement `FnMut`"
        x * acc
    });
}

# FnOnce closures can only be called once. They exist because some closure move out variables that have been moved when captured:
fn foobar<F>(f: F)
    where F: FnOnce() -> String
{
    println!("{}", f());
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("alright");
    foobar(move || s);
    // `s` was moved into our closure, and our
    // closures moves it to the caller by returning
    // it. Remember that `String` is not `Copy`.
}

# This is enforced naturally, as FnOnce closures need to be moved in order to be called.
# So, for example, this is illegal:
fn foobar<F>(f: F)
    where F: FnOnce() -> String
{
    println!("{}", f());
    println!("{}", f());
    // error: use of moved value: `f`
}

# And, if you need convincing that our closure does move s, this is illegal too:
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("alright");
    foobar(move || s);
    foobar(move || s);
    // use of moved value: `s`
}

# But this is fine:

    foobar(|| s.clone());
    foobar(|| s.clone());
}

# Here's a closure with two arguments:

    };
    println!("{} is greater than {}", greater, smaller);
}

fn main() {
    foobar(32, 64, |x, y| x > y);
}

# Here's a closure ignoring both its arguments:
fn main() {
    foobar(32, 64, |_, _| panic!("Comparing is futile!"));
}

# Here's a slightly worrying closure:
fn countdown<F>(count: usize, tick: F)

    }
}

fn main() {
    countdown(3, |i| println!("tick {}...", i));
}
// output:
// tick 3...
// tick 2...
// tick 1...

# And here's a toilet closure:
fn main() {
    countdown(3, |_| ());
}

# Called thusly because |_| () looks like a toilet.
# Anything that is iterable can be used in a for in loop.
# We've just seen a range being used, but it also works with a Vec:
fn main() {
    for i in vec![52, 49, 21] {
        println!("I like the number {}", i);
    }
}

# Or a slice:
fn main() {
    for i in &[52, 49, 21] {
        println!("I like the number {}", i);
    }
}
// output:
// I like the number 52
// I like the number 49
// I like the number 21

# Or an actual iterator:
fn main() {
    // note: `&str` also has a `.bytes()` iterator.
    // Rust's `char` type is a "Unicode scalar value"
    for c in "rust".chars() {
        println!("Give me a {}", c);
    }
}
// output:
// Give me a r
// Give me a u
// Give me a s
// Give me a t

# Even if the iterator items are filtered and mapped and flattened:
fn main() {
    for c in "SuRPRISE INbOUND"
        .chars()
        .filter(|c| c.is_lowercase())
        .flat_map(|c| c.to_uppercase())
    {
        print!("{}", c);
    }
    println!();

// output: UB

# You can return a closure from a function:
