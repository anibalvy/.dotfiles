# My dotfiles

personal script to install new workspaces tools.


## Requirements
- stow installed

## Installation 

1. It is tested to run from Home directory under .dotfiles folder, so clone from it

git clone https://github.com/anibalvy/.dotfiles.git
```

1. run install script

```sh
.dotfiles/bin/./dotfiles.sh
```

or manually

```

## TODO

1. check installation script:
- deprecated tools
- add package installations
